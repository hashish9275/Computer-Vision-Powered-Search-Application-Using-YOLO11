# Computer-Vision-Powered-Search-Application-Using-YOLO11
```
This application is a Streamlit-based search engine designed to index and query large image directories using metadata generated by a YOLOv11 object detection model. It first processes images, extracts class counts and bounding boxes, and stores this information as searchable JSON metadata, or loads a pre-existing metadata file. The user interface allows complex filtering by selecting target classes, applying count thresholds (e.g., max instances of an object), and choosing between 'AND' or 'OR' search logic. The filtering algorithm then iterates through the dataset, checking if image detection counts meet the quantitative criteria specified for the selected classes. Matching images are displayed in a responsive grid, dynamically overlaid with bounding boxes for visual verification of the detections. Finally, the application provides an option to export the set of filtered results as a detailed JSON file, offering an efficient tool for large-scale computer vision data analysis.
